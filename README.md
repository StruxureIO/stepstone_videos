# HumHub Videos Module

StepStone Videos Module 
 
The StepStone Videos Module will allow administrators to add embedded video links to the 
Videos page. One or more video tags can be assigned each video and users can mark 
individual videos as their favorites. 
 
On the Videos page, a list of the most popular tags appears across the top of the page. 
Clicking on one of these tags will display all the videos that are assigned that tag. To display all 
the videos again, select All Tags from the dropdown list on the top right side of the page. 
 
Video tags are adding though the Video Tags link in the Administration menu. Clicking this link 
will display the Videos Edit Tags page. To add a new tag, click the Add Tag button at the 
bottom of the page. On the Add New Tag page, enter a new video tag name and select 
whether to display the tag on the top of the videos page or keep the tag from appearing on the 
list of top tags. But default, these two options are turned off. Click the Save button to save the 
new tab.  
 
Also on the Videos Edit Tags page, existing video tags can be edit by clicking on the edit icon 
or deleted by click on the trash icon. 
 
To add a new video, from the Videos page within a space (all Humhub content has to originate 
in a space), Click the Add/Edit Video link in the left column menu. This link is only available for 
Administrators. At the top of the Videos Administration page, click the Add Video button which 
will display the Add Video page. Enter the video's title, description, embed code and select one 
or more video tags. 
 
From the embed code, a video thumbnail can be generated. Click the Generate Thumbnail 
Image button to import a thumbnail image from vimeo.com. In some cases, this may fail if the 
embed code includes extra text after the video's ID number. Usually the function for getting the 
video id will work if the video id, which is the number that appears after '
player.vimeo.com/video/', is followed by a question mark character with additional video 
parameters after it or a double quote mark which marks the end of the video src attribute. If 
that is not the case, remove the addition text after the video ID number so that the number 
ends with the double quote mark and click the Generate Thumbnail Image button. 
 
In case where one wants to upload an image to be used as a video thumbnail image, an image 
can be selected from your computer by clicking the browse button and selecting an image file. 
When the Save button is clicked, the image file will be uploaded. To view the image file, edit 
the new video record and you will see the new image and the path to the image in the Video 
Thumbnail File field. If you want to remove the current video thumbnail image, just clear the 
text in the Video Thumbnail File field or upload a different file and save the video. 
 
The video page menu allows the user to view their favorite videos or the most popular videos 
(the ones with the most views) or the latest videos, which is the main videos page. The latest 
videos page display videos in order they were added. In addition to these, there are menu 
options to display videos tagged as either Masterminds or Training Videos or Case Studies.
